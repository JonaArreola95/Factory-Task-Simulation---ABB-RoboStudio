# Factory-Task-Simulation---ABB-RoboStudio
Provided with a couple of tasks, the module assignment targeted to develop skills in robot systems integration and simulation under the ABB RoboStudio environment. It included activities such as camera vision systems and metrology systems review to integrate into the solution. Cycle time consideration and, technical requirements fulfillment. It required manipulator assessment based on its capabilities (max payload, workspace, reach, etc.). The modeling of an end effector was also required. The equipment was CAD modeled to support the simulation environment and the presentation of the results.
